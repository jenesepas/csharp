It’s impossible for people to move around physically in a "virtual 3D world",
we therefore use a "camera" to get orientated. When setting up a basic
camera in OpenGL there are two main subjects to be taken into consideration,
the camera handling and the perspective. 


An OpenGL camera consists of three vectors: position, view and up.
The "position", is the actual point where the camera is located,
while the "view" is the target point that the camera is looking at.
If you're standing in a room looking at a picture on the wall,
then your eyes are the position and the picture is the view.
You can say that the position point and the target point form a 
view-vector.The "up" or "tilt" decides if the camera is tilting
(used in flight simulators). 


You can set up your "camera lens" in OpenGL by altering the perspective values. 
The perspective of an OpenGL camera consists of four elements: fovy, aspect,
near and far. "Fovy" specifies the field of view angle, in degrees,
in the y-direction. "Aspect" specifies the aspect ratio that determines the
field of view in the x-direction. The aspect ratio is the ratio of x (width)
to y (height). "Near" specifies the distance from the viewer to the nearest
clipping plane (always positive). "Far" specifies the disistance from the viewer
to the far clipping plane (always positive). 

This is the first camera tutorial it lets you move forward and backward.

The Move_Camera function moves the camera in the direction of our view vector.
This means that it moves along the view vector by the camera speed that is passed in.

The Position_Camera function positions the camera.

In this tutorial the view vector is parallel to the the z-axis,
so the camera is only able move forwards and backwards.

Use the arrow keys to move.
